+ Data analysis:
- Included in the codebase there is an R script named "Analysis.R"
- The R script contains all the dataframes and plots used in the paper
- However, the R script uses data computed in the python scripts
- To repeat the experiments and generate your own sample data you can run the python code
- Warning: The python code needs about a day to complete a full run
- To run the R analysis you will need the following packages: ggplot2, dplyr, hrbrthemes, viridis and cowplot
- Don't forget to set the right file paths for the score data sets

+ Data generation:
- There are three different parts to doing this correctly, that are listed in the order that works provably.
- 1. Installing the python package networkx version 2.4 to run "LFRNetworkGenerator.py" to make the two sets of benchmarks
- 2. Then when we want to analyze the optimizer scores the package cdlib with all options should be installed to run "NetworkScienceCommunityDetection.py", using the command "pip install cdlib[C]" but this only works for linux and mac.
- 3. After this we can analyze the deterioration scores by installing the newest version of infomap with the command "pip install infomap --upgrade" to run the script "NetworkScienceDeterioration.py".

Combining the generation of the data with the analysis the tables and figures of the paper can be reproduced.
